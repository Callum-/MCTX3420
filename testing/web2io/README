This software will implement an interface between requests via HTTP and low level sensors/control on the server.

Briefly investigated CGI scripts. Realised that interprocess communication will be difficult and complex.
Low level sensors will be polled continuously, but the client will not be continuously receiving information.

Currently looking at implementing webserver and low level sensors/control in the same program on the server.
