Electronics
 - What inputs will be provided
   - 2x ADC channels, USB Hub (2 webcams?)
 - What outputs are required
   - 2x digital out for controlling multiplexers on ADCs
     - Switch time for multiplexer? Affects sample rate
   - 1x PWM to control DAC -> Analogue pressure regulator (?)
   - 3x digital out for controlling solenoids
 - Need to meet this week to work out sampling rate / antialiasing stuff
   - Friday 12:00pm -> 2:00pm
   - Wednesday 10:00am -> 11:00am
 - Antialiasing: Need to sample at 2x rate we are interested in
   - Accuracy of timestamps in software uncertain; should do some physical tests 
   - Estimates of BBB sampling rates vary, but from Jeremy's searches, the worst case:
     - 34KHz for GPIO
     - 100KHz for ADC

Pneumatics
 - What is being controlled -> Electronics
   - Analogue controlled pressure regulator 0-5V
   - 3 solenoids (on/off)
     - Master valve (safety)
      - 1 valve for each can (mutually exclusive, never allow both to be on at the same time) - need 12V for on, 20ms switch time, max freq 10Hz
       - Electronics will probably use a multiplexer
       - Will dump air when no power
	   - Diode protection needed
 - When can fails, major drop in pressure will happen
   - Should stop air supply when this is detected
 - What is sensed?
   - 3 x pressure sensors; 1 on main supply, 1 before each can
 - Pressure limit of 100KPa on non-exploding can
   - Safety threshold if sensor after this records > 100KPa
 - No limit on exploding can
 - Forgot to ask about *minimum* pressure values; use atmosphere (because if things fall below atmosphere they are probably broken)?

Sensors
 - Sensors -> Electronics -> Us
 - Currently having argument with Adrian about use of interferometer or dilatometer
   - Adrian will probably win the argument
   - Image processing will be low priority for software until there is more certainty
     - From a software point of view, interferometer and dilatometer are about the same difficulty
       - Interferometer: Look for nodes (maximum change in intensity at laser wavelength)
       - Dilatometer: Look for edge of can (maximum change in intensity of can colour)
     - Laser light might be easier to process (larger intensity and larger intensity changes against dark background)
     - But laser interferometer kit will definitely be harder to set up and align and position
 - Sampling rate of images (stream only) - 20FPS (using Logicrap(TM) camera)
     

Case
 - The software will fit
 - There will be a hole for an ethernet cable
