# Conversation held after creating the Week 12 progress report in google docs
 
Jeremy Tan joined group chat.
me
9:10 PM
Heh, I didn't expect everyone to start editing it so fast
Jeremy Tan
9:11 PM
hahah
what is this madness, working on it the day before
me
9:11 PM
Crazy
Jeremy: You weren't in IRC, but I hacked together a MySQL authentication thing to work with UserCake.
Jeremy Tan
9:11 PM
oO
me
9:11 PM
It seems to work well...
Although currently any random can register for an account.
Jeremy Tan
9:12 PM
Sorry, I was really busy sorting out the case study and my databases project (both due today)
me
9:12 PM
That's ok
Ironic... I spent all of today learning about a database :P
Jeremy Tan
9:13 PM
I was considering using php to redirect the user if they weren't logged it
in
but since you got this working, great
:P
Never heard of usercake though
me
9:14 PM
http://usercake.com/
It does need some modification
For some reason it stores privelage levels in a seperate table to the main users which is a pain for checking if someone is admin or not
Jeremy Tan
9:14 PM
how do you interact with the db? does mysql have a C api?
me
9:15 PM
And of course it has single user registration, so I'm currently trying to make a mass registration form that only the admin can use
Yes, MySQL has a C API
Jeremy Tan
9:15 PM
that must be a pain to work with
me
9:15 PM
Actually not really
Jeremy Tan
9:15 PM
Really?
I was trying something similar with sqlite and the django db
me
9:15 PM
At least just for the simple task of looking up a user
Jeremy Tan
9:16 PM
ah
I got the django one as far as getting the user entry
but then the data is base64 encoded
and uses sha256 hashing
effort
me
9:16 PM
Ahaha
PHP has the same crypt() function as posix which made it easier
Jeremy Tan
9:16 PM
yeah, except crypt is really insecure
but I guess they dont care
so meh
me
9:17 PM
Someone would have to get access to the database to even look at the hashes first
But MySQL doesn't have a great reputation either
Jeremy Tan
9:19 PM
well that's where the problem lies anyway
it's all about if the user gets access to the db, then you're in a really bad position if you've used crypt
mysql has better performance than sqlite though (probably)
About the control page - we haven't differentiated between a 'strain' and an 'explode' experiment. What controls are also necessary anyway? e.g do we even want the user to be able to control the pressure for the explode version?
me
9:20 PM
The easiest way to do it is to just have "strain/explode" switch the relay and otherwise use the same controls, I'm not sure if that's OK or not though
Jeremy Tan
9:23 PM
Okay
How does that UMS affect the current api
and user control
/login
me
9:23 PM
Not at all
Jeremy Tan
9:23 PM
So is login handled by that cake or the api (or both)?
me
9:24 PM
It's entirely seperate, except you can pass a mysql authentication method to the server
UserCake handles it's own login
Our API still has seperate login
It just accesses the same database
Jeremy Tan
9:24 PM
ahh
very similar to the django idea then
user cake is in php?
me
9:24 PM
Yes, I think that's the best way to do it anyway
And yes, UserCake is PHP
Jeremy Tan
9:26 PM
Yeah
Django's annoying to set up, and then you have to worry about python too
'Yet antoher*'
hahaha
me
9:26 PM
Hmm, what's a good justification for it
Jeremy Tan
9:27 PM
One thing though
we probably have to change cookie handling in the api
usercake probably stores its own cookies
me
9:27 PM
Maybe, and yes
Jeremy Tan
9:27 PM
and that will definitely screw up things
me
9:27 PM
Maybe... probably...
Jeremy Tan
9:27 PM
but I was planning on doing something about taht anyway
me
9:27 PM
Iceweasel seems to always send the nameless cookie first...
Jeremy Tan
9:27 PM
oh yeah, that's right
me
9:27 PM
So I just truncated the cookie at the first ';'
Jeremy Tan
9:28 PM
yesterday I limited it
nah
it snprintfs exactly the size of the control cookie
so if the cookie's first, then it's all good
me
9:28 PM
I think so
But when you logout I think it sets the cookie to "0"
Jeremy Tan
9:29 PM
yeah
shouldn't be an issue since it won't match
but I was thinking of switching to a named cookie
PHP can't handle the nameless cookie though (something I found out today)
me
9:29 PM
It shouldn't but it feels wrong...
Switching to a named cookie is probably a good idea
Jeremy Tan
9:29 PM
yeah
I'll try that now
Jeremy Tan
9:33 PM
usercake's not on git, is it?
me
9:34 PM
Not yet, it's on my local machine in a new branch
Should I push it now?
Jeremy Tan
9:34 PM
ah
that would be good if you could
Jeremy Tan
9:43 PM
You know you've spent too long writing javascript when you default to writing !==
me
9:43 PM
Ahahaha
me
9:57 PM
I think I'll call it quits for now
Jeremy Tan
9:58 PM
Okay
me
9:58 PM
I'll try upload this chat log since we didn't use IRC
Jeremy Tan
9:58 PM
See you tomorrow
me
9:58 PM
Bye
