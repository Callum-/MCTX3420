This code will run on the Raspberry Pi server.

The software will implement an interface between requests made by a browser using HTTP and low level sensors/control on the server.

Multiple threads will be used; one running a HTTP server, and one or more for interacting with sensors/actuators.
A watchdog program should be created to start the main server program and handle software crashes.
