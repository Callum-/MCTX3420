This code will run on the server.

The software will implement an interface between requests made by a browser using HTTP and low level sensors/control on the server.

Multiple threads will be used; one responding to HTTP requests, and one or more for interacting with sensors/actuators.
A watchdog bash script can becreated to start the main server program and handle software crashes.

Note: Documentation can be generated using Doxygen.
